## NonameCo
In this model, I examine the case of Noname co, an apparel retail company. 
Noname Co was asked to improve its solvence and interest coverage ratio in order for its bank to extend the credit line. The bank requires a leverage ratio lower than 55% and an equity multiplier of less than 2.7. 

Hence, the objecif is analyze three investment opportunities which might help Noname co meet this goal: (1) Investment in a TV show porgram to increase sales, (2) Sell additional shares to an IB, (3) Acquire Target co. 

Ultimately, I as a financial manager should decided which project to take on based on two main criteria: (1) the project should help Noname co meet the bank requirement and (2) the project should protect the interest of existing shareholders.


## HasNameCo
HasNameco would like to budget its sales and production costs for the next six months in order to meet the management target sales. The objectif is to forecast sales and thereby analyzed how it will impact the production and overall costs for each product.
