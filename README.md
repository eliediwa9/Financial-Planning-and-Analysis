## [Security and Portfolio Performance Analysis (pdf)](https://github.com/eliediwa9/Financial-and-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Security%20and%20Portfolio%20Performance%20Analysis%20.pdf)
The objective of this article is to present essential concepts in security analysis and portfolio selection. We have conducted an analysis of two investment portfolios: one consisting of technology firms and the other composed of health firms. By applying the Markowitz optimization model, we have identified the optimal portfolio for each category. Additionally, we have addressed the challenges associated with comparing portfolios using historical and expected returns, and have introduced more robust measures for portfolio evaluation and selection.

## [Analyse de la Performance des Titres et des Portefeuilles(pdf)](https://github.com/eliediwa9/Financial-and-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Analyse%20de%20la%20Performance%20des%20Titres%20et%20des%20Portefeuilles.pdf)
L'objectif de cet article est de présenter les concepts essentiels de l'analyse des valeurs mobilières et de la sélection de portefeuille. Nous avons réalisé une analyse de deux portefeuilles d'investissement : l'un composé d'entreprises technologiques et l'autre composé d'entreprises de santé. En appliquant le modèle d'optimisation de Markowitz, nous avons identifié le portefeuille optimal pour chaque catégorie. De plus, nous avons abordé les défis liés à la comparaison des portefeuilles en utilisant les rendements historiques et attendus, et avons présenté des mesures plus robustes pour l'évaluation et la sélection des portefeuilles.

## [Credit analysis: Part 1. Exploratory data analysis (pdf)](https://github.com/eliediwa9/Financial-and-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Credit%20Analysis%20Part%201.pdf)
This case is about analyzing the credit profile of a pool of customers that applied for a bank loan. The management of the bank asked me as their credit (data) analyst to review the risk profile of loan applicants and come up with a model that they can use later on to decide on whether to give a loan or not. In part 1, I start with familiarizing myself with the data by exploring and uncovering trends and relationships that exist among them.

## [Credit analysis : Part 2. Testing for the difference (pdf)](https://github.com/eliediwa9/Financial-and-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Credit%20Analysis%20Part%202.pdf)
In Part 2, I seek evidence for the differences observed through visualization in Part 1. Using statistical tests such as two sample Z test, annova, chi-square among others. This further paves our way to the construction of a prediction models.

## [Credit analysis : Part 3. Modelling (pdf)](https://github.com/eliediwa9/Financial-and-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Credit%20Analysis%20Part%203.pdf)
In Part 3, we attempt to buit a first credit risk model using logistic regression. We find that property value, loan amount and loan term are consistently significant in all models obtained from backward elimination. This suggests that these variables better explain the change in default likelihood among our customers than any other variable. Nonetheless, the model has a relatively low accuracy rate of about 80%. 

## [Probability Distribution and Mean Testing (pdf)](https://github.com/eliediwa9/Financial-and-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Probability%20Distribution%20and%20Statistical%20Testing%20.pdf)
In this article, I explain the concepts of probability distribution and statistical testing for the mean of the population in very simple terms. In the process, I introduce terminologies such as mean, variance, standard deviation, standard errors, distribution, probability, sampling distribution of sample means, central limit theorem, Z test among others in a story-like manner to help readers connect the dots between them.
