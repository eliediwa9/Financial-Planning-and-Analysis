# Financial and Data Analysis

Welcome to my page. Here, I showcase my analytical skills and technical aptitudes in Excel, R and Python. You will find a range of projects ranging from finance to data analysis. Each project is briefly describe below to help you choose the project of interest.

If you are new to Github, I acknowledge that it can be quite difficult to find your way around. Hence, after you choose a project, click on the title and you'll be directed to a new page. If the file is in xls(x) format, click on view raw in the prompted page or on downnload raw file. If the file is in pdf, Github will display the first 5 pages and you can click on "more pages" to read more. 

**Important: Excel file will ask you to enter a PW but please ignore it and click on read-only.**

## [NonameCo FPA & VALUATION (xlsx)]( https://github.com/eliediwa9/Financial-Planning-and-Analysis/blob/main/NoNameCo%20FPA%20%26%20valuation.xlsx)
This model is about solving the case of a company, here referred as Noname co, who is facing difficulties to extend its credit line. The bank requires the firm to lower its leverage and times earned ratio by next year or otherwise it will not extend its credit. A simple optimization of the firm's operations will not suffice to meet the bank requirements. Hence, Noname is considering three alternatives:(1) Investment in a TV show porgram that will increase sales, (2) Sell additional shares to an Investment Bank or (3) Acquire Target co. 

As a financial manager, my task is to analyze these investments options and decided which project to take  based on two main criteria: (1) the project should help Noname co meet the bank requirement and (2) the project should protect the interest of existing shareholders. Check out to how I modelled this business case and came up with a solution for Nonameco. Questions regarding this case are welcomed.


## [HasNameCo MASTER BUDGET(xlsx)](https://github.com/eliediwa9/Financial-Planning-and-Analysis/blob/main/HasNameCo%20Master-Plan.xlsx)
This case is about a firm, here referred to as Hasname co, who would like to budget its sale and operating expenses for the next six months. The management assumes that sales will growth at a constant rate of 5% from the second month and forward starting at the current month figure. My task as a financial controller is to analyze how the increase in sales will expact the company costs and examnine the rentability of the firm two lines of product. 


## [XYZ firm financial data analysis (xlsx)](https://github.com/eliediwa9/Financial-Planning-and-Analysis/blob/main/XYZ%20Financial%20data%20analysis.xlsx)
This case is about analyze the performance of XYZ firm which has about 10 lines of product and is presented in multiple country. The management of XYZ firm is interested to know the financial performance of their products sold in several countries. More specifically, the management would like to know how profitable each line of product is and how the rentability is in each month and each country. They also want to compare current year performance to last year and seek to uncover trends.	

## [Security and Portfolio Performance Analysis (pdf)](https://github.com/eliediwa9/Financial-and-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Security%20and%20Portfolio%20Performance%20Analysis%20.pdf)
The objective of this article is to present essential concepts in security analysis and portfolio selection. We have conducted an analysis of two investment portfolios: one consisting of technology firms and the other composed of health firms. By applying the Markowitz optimization model, we have identified the optimal portfolio for each category. Additionally, we have addressed the challenges associated with comparing portfolios using historical and expected returns, and have introduced more robust measures for portfolio evaluation and selection.

## [Analyse de la Performance des Titres et des Portefeuilles](https://github.com/eliediwa9/Financial-and-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Analyse%20de%20la%20Performance%20des%20Titres%20et%20des%20Portefeuilles.pdf)
L'objectif de cet article est de présenter les concepts essentiels de l'analyse des valeurs mobilières et de la sélection de portefeuille. Nous avons réalisé une analyse de deux portefeuilles d'investissement : l'un composé d'entreprises technologiques et l'autre composé d'entreprises de santé. En appliquant le modèle d'optimisation de Markowitz, nous avons identifié le portefeuille optimal pour chaque catégorie. De plus, nous avons abordé les défis liés à la comparaison des portefeuilles en utilisant les rendements historiques et attendus, et avons présenté des mesures plus robustes pour l'évaluation et la sélection des portefeuilles.

## [Credit analysis: Part 1. Exploratory data analysis (pdf)](https://github.com/eliediwa9/Financial-and-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Credit%20Analysis%20Part%201.pdf)
This case is about analyzing the credit profile of a pool of customers that applied for a bank loan. The management of the bank asked me as their credit (data) analyst to review the risk profile of loan applicants and come up with a model that they can use later on to decide on whether to give a loan or not. In part 1, I start with familiarizing myself with the data by exploring and uncovering trends and relationships that exist among them.

## [Credit analysis : Part 2. Testing for the difference (pdf)](https://github.com/eliediwa9/Financial-and-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Credit%20Analysis%20Part%202.pdf)
In Part 2, I seek evidence for the differences observed through visualization in Part 1. Using statistical tests such as two sample Z test, annova, chi-square among others. This further paves our way to the construction of a prediction models.

## [Credit analysis : Part 3. Modelling (pdf)](https://github.com/eliediwa9/Financial-and-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Credit%20Analysis%20Part%203.pdf)
In Part 3, we attempt to buit a first credit risk model using logistic regression. We find that property value, loan amount and loan term are consistently significant in all models obtained from backward elimination. This suggests that these variables better explain the change in default likelihood among our customers than any other variable. Nonetheless, the model has a relatively low accuracy rate of about 80%. 


## [Probability Distribution and Mean Testing (pdf)](https://github.com/eliediwa9/Financial-and-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Probability%20Distribution%20and%20Statistical%20Testing%20.pdf)
In this article, I explain the concepts of probability distribution and statistical testing for the mean of the population in very simple terms. In the process, I introduce terminologies such as mean, variance, standard deviation, standard errors, distribution, probability, sampling distribution of sample means, central limit theorem, Z test among others in a story-like manner to help readers connect the dots between them.
