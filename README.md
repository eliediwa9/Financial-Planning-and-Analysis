# Financial and Data Analysis

Welcome! On this page, I showcase my knowledge and analytical skills using tools such as Excel, R and Python. You will find a range of projects ranging from finance to data analysis. A brief description is provided for each project below to help you decide. I regularly publish new projects or improve existing ones to demonstrate my mastery of knowledges & concepts pertaining to finance, accounting and data analysis. I believe that this not only improve transparency during the recruitment process but also shows that I am an autonomous, proactive, result-oriented and determined individual who consistently seeks self-improvement and growth.

## [NonameCo FPA & VALUATION (xlsx)]( https://github.com/eliediwa9/Financial-Planning-and-Analysis/blob/main/NoNameCo%20FPA%20%26%20valuation.xlsx)
Fanancial planning and analysis, including investment analysis and valuation. Noname co is facing difficulties to extend its credit line. The bank requires the firm to lower its leverage and times earned ratio by year 2012 or otherwise it will not extend its credit. Hence, Noname is considering three alternatives:(1) Investment in a TV show porgram that will increase sales, (2) Sell additional shares to an Investment Bank or (3) Acquire Target co. 


## [HasNameCo MASTER BUDGET(xlsx)](https://github.com/eliediwa9/Financial-Planning-and-Analysis/blob/main/HasNameCo%20Master-Plan.xlsx)
Operational budgeting (master budget) of Hasname co activities. The firm would like to budget its operations for the next six months. As a financial controller, my goal is to construct a complete master budget to help the top management make informed decisions.


## [XYZ firm financial data analysis (xlsx)](https://github.com/eliediwa9/Financial-Planning-and-Analysis/blob/main/XYZ%20Financial%20data%20analysis.xlsx)
Business Analysis for XYZ firm which has about 10 lines of product and is present in multiple country. The management would like to know how profitable each line of product is in each country, each month and each year. Hence, my task is to break down product performance into several subgroups to be able to answer these strategic questions.

## [Security and Portfolio Performance Analysis (pdf)](https://github.com/eliediwa9/Financial-and-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Security%20and%20Portfolio%20Performance%20Analysis%20.pdf)
The objective of this article is to present essential concepts in security analysis and portfolio selection. We have conducted an analysis of two investment portfolios: one consisting of technology firms and the other composed of health firms. By applying the Markowitz optimization model, we have identified the optimal portfolio for each category. Additionally, we have addressed the challenges associated with comparing portfolios using historical and expected returns, and have introduced more robust measures for portfolio evaluation and selection.

## [Analyse de la Performance des Titres et des Portefeuilles(pdf)](https://github.com/eliediwa9/Financial-and-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Analyse%20de%20la%20Performance%20des%20Titres%20et%20des%20Portefeuilles.pdf)
L'objectif de cet article est de présenter les concepts essentiels de l'analyse des valeurs mobilières et de la sélection de portefeuille. Nous avons réalisé une analyse de deux portefeuilles d'investissement : l'un composé d'entreprises technologiques et l'autre composé d'entreprises de santé. En appliquant le modèle d'optimisation de Markowitz, nous avons identifié le portefeuille optimal pour chaque catégorie. De plus, nous avons abordé les défis liés à la comparaison des portefeuilles en utilisant les rendements historiques et attendus, et avons présenté des mesures plus robustes pour l'évaluation et la sélection des portefeuilles.

## [Credit analysis: Part 1. Exploratory data analysis (pdf)](https://github.com/eliediwa9/Financial-and-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Credit%20Analysis%20Part%201.pdf)
This case is about analyzing the credit profile of a pool of customers that applied for a bank loan. The management of the bank asked me as their credit (data) analyst to review the risk profile of loan applicants and come up with a model that they can use later on to decide on whether to give a loan or not. In part 1, I start with familiarizing myself with the data by exploring and uncovering trends and relationships that exist among them.

## [Credit analysis : Part 2. Testing for the difference (pdf)](https://github.com/eliediwa9/Financial-and-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Credit%20Analysis%20Part%202.pdf)
In Part 2, I seek evidence for the differences observed through visualization in Part 1. Using statistical tests such as two sample Z test, annova, chi-square among others. This further paves our way to the construction of a prediction models.

## [Credit analysis : Part 3. Modelling (pdf)](https://github.com/eliediwa9/Financial-and-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Credit%20Analysis%20Part%203.pdf)
In Part 3, we attempt to buit a first credit risk model using logistic regression. We find that property value, loan amount and loan term are consistently significant in all models obtained from backward elimination. This suggests that these variables better explain the change in default likelihood among our customers than any other variable. Nonetheless, the model has a relatively low accuracy rate of about 80%. 

## [Probability Distribution and Mean Testing (pdf)](https://github.com/eliediwa9/Financial-and-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Probability%20Distribution%20and%20Statistical%20Testing%20.pdf)
In this article, I explain the concepts of probability distribution and statistical testing for the mean of the population in very simple terms. In the process, I introduce terminologies such as mean, variance, standard deviation, standard errors, distribution, probability, sampling distribution of sample means, central limit theorem, Z test among others in a story-like manner to help readers connect the dots between them.
